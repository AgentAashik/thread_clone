**Thread App Clone using Next.js and MongoDB with Tailwind CSS**

This repository contains a clone of the Thread App built using Next.js for the frontend, MongoDB for the backend, and styled with Tailwind CSS. The Thread App is a platform that allows users to create and participate in threaded conversations, providing a dynamic and organized way to engage in discussions.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to the app using their email and password. User authentication ensures that only registered users can create and participate in threads(clerk).

- **Thread Creation**: Authenticated users can create new threads by providing a title and an initial message. This starts a new conversation that other users can join.

- **Message Threads**: Threads consist of a series of messages organized in a hierarchical manner. Users can reply to existing messages, creating threaded conversations.

- **Real-time Updates**: The app utilizes real-time updates to ensure that users can see new messages as they are added to the threads. This provides a seamless and interactive conversation experience.

- **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile that displays their basic information, including their username and profile picture.
